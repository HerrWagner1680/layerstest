real challenge is when to load assets

divide into sets
no more than 10 images to a set

a set could have same background
one or two gifs that remain and don't change
then 4 or 5 gifs or layers that do change

a new set would load as if it were a new panel with all new assets
for this early easy version we'll load when we need it, when
the viewer requests to see it

in later versions you could load two or three sets at a time
always have the next one loading so no wait time
like the infinite scroll on duckduckgo

========================
DESCRIBING THE JSON OBJECT OF ONE SET

Each step is a frame (or panel).
You can describe the contents of that frame. Lowest Z-index number first
Say Frame 1: trees.gif z-index: -500, characters.png z-index: -300,
wagon.png z-index -200, wheels.gif z-index 100, text_balloon1.gif z-index 200

Say Frame 1: same, same, same, same, text_balloon2.gif z-index200

You can use "same" as a kind of ditto, "do not refresh" comment.

Early version, you don't event have to add z-index to the CSS. It can
just be there as a way of defining the layer positions.

-----
You also want a thumbnail image representing each set
That way you can quickly scroll ahead, or scroll backwards.

You can even have an opacity setting on the layers, in order
to create a kind of texture.
